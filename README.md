Deploy your open-source project to npm with ease, with fully covered bundling, testing, linting and deployment setup out of the box,
don't worry about CJS or ESM, bundling your typescript definitions or anything else, focus on coding out your solution and let the stack take care of the rest.

Build your own open-source project today! 🚀

## Tools

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vitest**: A modern test runner built on top of Vite.
- **Biome**: Biome statically analyzes your code to find issues and formats your code with a consistent, opinionated style.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate your workflow from idea to production.
- **tsdown** - Simple to config bundler powered by rolldown.
- **Changeset** - A way to manage your versioning and changelog with a focus on monorepos.
- **pnpm workspaces** - A way to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

## Features

- **ESM/CJS ready** - Write your code in TypeScript and publish it as ESM and CJS with 0 configuration.
- **Are The types wrong? ready** - Passes all the checks for typings on https://arethetypeswrong.github.io/ by default.
- **ESM/CJS test apps setup** - Test your package in both ESM and CJS environments already setup for you.
